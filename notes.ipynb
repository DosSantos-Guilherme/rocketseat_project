    "# HTML\n",
    "It is a marking language, structured by tags that define the content of a web page.\n",
    "# CSS\n",
    "It defines the style of a element, the definitions works in a cascade, where the last definition overwrittes the previous one, respecting its order and specificity.\n",
    "## Border-box\n",
    "By default the size of an element is defined by the sum of padding, margin, and content. That is not intuitive and developers usually set for the whole css the border-box type of sizing. Where the actual element size is defined only by content. That is done by:\n",

    "It is a way of representing a HTML element as a rectilinear box with marging, padding, and content.\n",
    "# Block vs inline elements\n",
    "By default some structures are already defined as block or as inline elements. \n",
    "## Block\n",
    "The block elements ocopy the whole line, not letting anything to be at their side.\n",
    "## Inline\n",
    "The inline elements only ocupy it's content which allows some other inline structures to be at their side.\n",
    "### Issue generated by the default block or inline structures\n",
    "That creates a behavior where some commands might not work. For instance, if you use margin: auto for a blocked element it will get centralized, while it would not work for a inline one. \n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "If the upward container is inline you can send styles aiming for aligning whatever is inside. So you can align by setting `text-align:center;`\n",
    "\n",
    "# Flex\n",
    "It allows elements to fit in one direction, occupying all there is to occupy within this content. The default is horizontal, but you can change it.\n",
    "The display flex creates a line in the middle of the content, named main. You can use that to align vertically.\n",
    "\n",
    "# position: relative\n",
    "That will not alter the element itself, but all absolute elements within it will have absolute position respective to the upward element.\n"
